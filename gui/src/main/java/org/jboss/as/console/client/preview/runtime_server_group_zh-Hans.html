    <h1>Server Groups</h1>
    <p>A server group is set of server instances that will be managed and configured as one. In a managed domain each application server instance is a member of a server group (even if the group only has a single server, the server is still a member of a group).</p>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the Domain Controller and the Host Controllers to ensure that all servers in a server group have a consistent configuration. They should all be configured with the same profile and they should have the same deployment content deployed.</p>
    <h2>Common Configuration Tasks</h2>
    <p>Configure settings for this server group and perform operations such as starting, stopping, and reloading all servers that belong to this server group.</p>
