<div class='preview-content'><h1>PicketLink Federations</h1>
    <p>When using the PicketLink subsystem to configure and deploy your identity providers and service providers, all of them are grouped in a Federation.</p>
    <p>A Federation can be understood as a Circle of Trust (CoT) from which applications share common configurations (certificates, saml specific configurations, etc) and where each participating domain is trusted to accurately document the processes used to identify a user, the type of authentication system used, and any policies associated with the resulting authentication credentials.</p>
    <p>Each federation has one Identity Provider and many Service Providers. You do not need to specify for each SP the IDP that it trusts, because this is defined by the federation.</p>
