    <h1>JMS Bridge</h1>
    <p>The function of a JMS bridge is to consume messages from a source JMS destination, and send them to a target JMS destination. Typically either the source or the target destinations are on different servers.</p>
    <p>The bridge can also be used to bridge messages from other non Artemis JMS servers, as long as they are JMS 1.1 compliant.</p>
    <p>The JMS Bridge is provided by the Artemis project. For a detailed description of the available configuration properties, please consult the project documentation.</p>
