    <h1>Hosts</h1>
    <p>All hosts that are members of this domain.</p>
    <p>In a managed domain, multiple server instances are managed from a single control point. A domain can span multiple physical or virtual machines, with all server instances under the control of a host controller. One host controller is configured to act as the central domain controller. All other host controllers interact with the domain controller to control the configuration and lifecycle of the application server instances.</p>
