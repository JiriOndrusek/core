    <h1>Interfaces</h1>
    A logical name for a network interface/IP address/host name to which sockets can be bound. The domain.xml, host.xml and standalone.xml configurations all include a section where interfaces can be declared. Other sections of the configuration can then reference those interfaces by their logical name, rather than having to include the full details of the interface (which may vary on different machines).
    <p/>
    An interface configuration includes the logical name of the interface as well as information specifying the criteria to use for resolving the actual physical address to use.

    See Interfaces and ports for further details.
