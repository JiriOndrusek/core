    <h1>Socket Bindings</h1>
    A socket binding is a named configuration for a socket. The domain.xml and standalone.xml configurations both include a section where named socket configurations can be declared. Other sections of the configuration can then reference those sockets by their logical name, rather than having to include the full details of the socket configuration (which may vary on different machines).
    See Interfaces and ports for full details.
