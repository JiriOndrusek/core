    <h1>Configuration Profile</h1>
    A profile is a named set of subsystem configurations. A subsystem is an added set of capabilities added to the core server by an extension. A subsystem provides servlet handling capabilities; a subsystem provides an EJB container; a subsystem provides JTA, etc. A profile is a named list of subsystems, along with the details of each subsystem's configuration. A profile with a large number of subsystems results in a server with a large set of capabilities. A profile with a small, focused set of subsystems will have fewer capabilities but a smaller footprint.
