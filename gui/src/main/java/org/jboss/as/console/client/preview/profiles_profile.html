    <h1>Profiles</h1>
    <p>A profile is a named set of subsystem configurations. A subsystem is a set of capabilities added to the core server by an extension. Subsystems provide capabilities like servlet handling capabilities, an EJB container, JTA, etc.</p>
    <p>A profile is a named list of subsystems, along with the details of each subsystem's configuration. A profile with a large number of subsystems results in a server with a large set of capabilities. A profile with a small, focused set of subsystems will have fewer capabilities but a smaller footprint.</p>
